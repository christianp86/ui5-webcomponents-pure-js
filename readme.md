# Using UI5 Webcomponents w/o any framework

This is a pure "academic" project to get a better understanding of how to use [UI5 webcomponents](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) without any framework such as React, Angular or Vue.

Currently I have the following versions
| Folder                                     | Content description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Initial Version](Initial%20version/)      | First try getting things working. Mix of HTML tags and JavaScript. Declaration and logic mixed up in JS |
| [HTML Template](html%20template%20version/)| Use template tag to define row and cells in HTML. JS only contains logic. Kudos to [Peter MÃ¼ssig](https://github.com/petermuessig)|


## How to run the project

npm run start will start a [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) instance and open index.html in your browser.
[Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) is added as dev dependency only.

```bash
git clone
cd FOLDER
npm install
npm run start
```

## Next steps

I will further explore ui5 webcomponents and combine it with webpack.
