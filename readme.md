# Using UI5 Webcomponents w/o any framework

This is a pure "academic" project to get a better understanding of how to use [UI5 webcomponents](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) usign pure vanilla javascript.

## How to run the project

npm run start will start a [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) instance and open index.html in your browser.
[Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) is added as dev dependency only.

```bash
git clone
npm install
npm run start
```

## Next steps

I will further explore ui5 webcomponents and combine it with webpack.
