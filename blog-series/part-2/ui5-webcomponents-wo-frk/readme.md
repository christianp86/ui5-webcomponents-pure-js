# Using UI5 Web Components w/o any framework

This is a pure "academic" project to get a better understanding of how to use [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) without any framework such as React, Angular or Vue.
My goal is to create blog series during which we will cover following topics
 * [Getting started with UI5 Web Components](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/30/using-ui5-web-components-without-any-framework/)
 * Enhancing our example using `<template>` tag
 * LetÂ´s create a bundle
 * I hate todo lists, so we create a shopping list example :wink:
 * Additional topics such as i18n, theming and create your own UI5 Web Components

 __WARNING!__
I am using modern JavaScript syntax that might not work with older browsers. Please use a modern browser :wink:

# Enhancing our example from [Part 1](../../part-1/ui5-webcomponents-wo-frk/readme.md)
