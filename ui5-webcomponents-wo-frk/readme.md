# Using UI5 Webcomponents w/o any framework

This is a pure "academic" project to get a better understanding of how to use [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) without any framework such as React, Angular or Vue.
My goal is to create blog series during which we will cover following topics
 * Getting started with UI5 Web Components
 * Enhancing our example using `<template>` tag
 * LetÂ´s create a bundle using webpack
 * I hate todo lists, so we create a shopping list example :wink:
 * Additional topics such as i18n, theming and create your own UI5 Web Components

# Getting started with UI5 webcomponents 
 
## First baby steps
This blog is a result of something I hacked together during SAP TechEd 2020. I wanted to get a first understanding how UI5 Web Components work and how I can use them.
The excellent [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/02/beyond-sapui5-and-sap-fiori-elements-appendix-to-teched-session-iis114/?source=social-Global-SAPdevs-TWITTER-MarketingCampaign-Developers-Fiori-spr-4273717682&campaigncode=CRM-XB20-MKT-DGEALL) from [Marius Obert](https://github.com/IObert) made me curios but as I am not much familiar with React, Angular or Vue, I wanted to keep things simple. In 2020, I started re-learning the basic and more advanced concepts of HTML and JS to get a better understanding of web development these days. I am more a hands-on person #HandsOnSAPDev and I get an itch to start building stuff once I understand (or think I understand :wink:) the basic concepts.

What we will do in this first blog is to create simple webapp that will contain a UI5 table and button.
The button will trigger displaying data in our table.

At the end it should look like the table example provided on the official documentation [UI5 Web Components Table](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/components/Table/) component

### Get started

So let's get our hands dirty by initializing our project using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```sh
mkdir ui5-webcomponents-wo-frk
cd ui5-webcomponents-wo-frk
npm init -y
```

We will create an HTML and a JavaScript file to keep things separate. By things I mean describing the form of the content (HTML) and the actual logic (JavaScript).

Before that we should actually know how we can create a UI5 Web Component. Looking at the [official documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/docs/how-to-use/#create) there are two ways to create a UI5 Web Component instance:
* Using HTML tags defined by the Web Component
* Using the HTML DOM API [createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)

Alright, let's do that and create our HTML file. To speed things up, I copied the table from the official documentation :wink: .

Nothing fancy here. We declare a table and create the columns. No table rows or cells yet to actually display any product data.

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>UI5 Web Components w/o Framework</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <ui5-table id="productsTable" no-data-text="No Data" show-no-data>
            <ui5-table-column slot="columns" style="width: 12rem">
                <span style="line-height: 1.4rem">Product</span>
            </ui5-table-column>

            <ui5-table-column slot="columns" min-width="800" popin-text="Supplier">
                <span style="line-height: 1.4rem">Supplier</span>
            </ui5-table-column>

            <ui5-table-column slot="columns" min-width="600" popin-text="Dimensions" demand-popin>
                <span style="line-height: 1.4rem">Dimensions</span>
            </ui5-table-column>

            <ui5-table-column slot="columns" min-width="600" popin-text="Weight" demand-popin>
                <span style="line-height: 1.4rem">Weight</span>
            </ui5-table-column>

            <ui5-table-column slot="columns">
                <span style="line-height: 1.4rem">Price</span>
            </ui5-table-column>
        </ui5-table>
    </div>
    
</body>

</html>
```

Yes we did it! We used the UI5 Web Components successfully in our HTML page. Or did we?
![where-is-my-ui5-table](./images/1%20where%20is%20my%20ui5%20table.png)

Well we are not there yet. Just because there is a tag does not mean the browser knows what to with it.
We have to let the browser know the tag and how what should be rendered (UI5 and Fiori style please).

UI5 Web Components are delivered as [ES6 Modules](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/es6-modules/). In order to use the modules we actually need to get them.
So we run:
```sh
npm install @ui5/webcomponents
```

Now we have the UI5 Web Components in the `node_modules` folder. Great. Hmmm, opening the page in your favourite web browser still shows only errors in the console.
!ADD IMAGE HERE
What we have to do is that the needed UI5 Web Components are actually loaded. Looking at the [documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/components/Table/) we find the following statements.

```js
import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Table.js";
import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/TableColumn.js";
```

Perfect, now we know what to do but we are still not clear where to put this code.
Reading again this [tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/es6-modules/) we realize that we have to create a JavaScript file in which we place the import statements.
We want to keep the JavaScript files in a different folder so we create one real quick
```sh
mkdir src
```

We also create a new file `index.js` and add the import statements in there. Nothing else. In addition, we have to load the JavaScript in our HTML document.
```html
<body>
...
</table>
<script type="module" src="./src/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

Finally! We are ready to see our beautiful UI5 table any seconds now...

![where-is-my-ui5-table](./images/2-where-is-my-ui5-table.png)

**WHAAAATTTT?**

This error tells us we can't just load js files who are importing ES6 modules when simply opening the html file in a browser.
So I guess we need a local web server to run our UI5 Web Components app. NPM to the rescue!
At the time of hacking this stuff together I was looking how to get easy to use webserver which supports ES6 modules. The one I used previously in non OpenUI5 projects did not work (or I would have to do some config stuff which I did not want to mess around with).

There a many options to choose from but I found the [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) and it worked out of the box. That's all I wanted :relaxed: for now.

To use it we will install it as a dev dependency
```sh
npm i --save-dev @web/dev-server
```

Let's the package.json and add an npm command to start the server
```json
...
"scripts": {
    "start": "wds --node-resolve --watch --open"
  },
...
```

Now all that's left todo is to run the command and see the "magic happen" :satisfied:
```sh
npm run start
```

Jippie, we finally see our empty table :wink: . It seems like a bit of effort but once you got the basics setup you are prepared for implementing the real thing.
And we already learned a lot on our little journey
 * How to install UI5 Web Components
 * Getting additional information from UI5 Web Components documentation
 * How to import the ES6 modules in JavaScript
 * How to load JavaScript files in HTML when ES6 modules are used
 * How to serve a webapp with ES6 modules using a local dev server

 Not too bad I would say. We will continue this journey in the next blog post where we will finally add some data the table :sparkles:.
